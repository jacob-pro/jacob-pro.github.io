## Personal Statement

I am currently a third year undergraduate student studying Computer Science at the University
of Bristol. I have professional experience working as a software developer, as well as good
knowledge of computer systems and networks. I am on track to finish my degree in summer this
year (2021), and am looking for employment as a software developer ideally in the Bristol area.
I'm very enthusiastic about working with modern languages such as Rust that can ensure
memory and concurrency safety without compromising performance.

## Experience

Software Development Internship – Oracle: Summer 2019 \
I had a 3-month internship as part of the API Gateway team at Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. 
I developed the backend for an internal tool used for auditing cloud resources, with a REST and WebSockets API developed in Java and deployed using Docker. 
I worked on performance metrics at the data plane of the API Gateway cloud service using Lua, 
and implemented scheduled business metrics at the control plane of the API Gateway service, 
along with a Grafana dashboard, used by management to monitor deployments and feature usage. 
I also worked on a feature to scale Gateways to support higher throughput.

Software Developer – Createanet: 2017 – 2018 \
Prior to starting university, I worked at Createanet for a year primarily as an iOS developer; I developed 6 iOS apps mainly using Objective-C (and also some Swift). 
One of these apps was a social media platform, others were for photo and video sharing, electronic forms, and video conferencing.  
I also developed REST APIs and administration websites to manage the apps using PHP and MySQL.

Part-Time – IT Support, Brixham College: 2011 – 2015 \
Whilst I was at Brixham College I had a part time job with the IT department. 
This mainly involved working with Microsoft products such as Windows Server, Active Directory, Exchange Server, and Hyper-V. 
I was responsible for setting up the automated deployment of operating systems and software, first using WDS and later SCCM, for around 500 PCs. 
I also configured and maintained the Remote Desktop services infrastructure for staff, students, and thin PCs.

I also maintain a list of projects I have worked on at [my website](https://www.jhalsey.com/projects.html), showing the software languages and frameworks that I am familiar with.
