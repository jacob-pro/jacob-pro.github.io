## Experience

Software Engineer - Oracle: 2021 - Present \
Working as part of the API Gateway team at Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. Primarily working with Java — developing REST
APIs, cloud controllers, and integration / canary tests.
I have also contributed to our public web console (React/Typescript), adding support for a new feature and resources. 
I help maintain automation tools written in Python, and have led efforts to improve code quality with more extensive 
CI checks.

I developed an internal tool used for auditing cloud resources, with a REST and WebSockets API implemented in Java and 
packaged with Docker. 
Worked on performance metrics at the data plane of the API Gateway service using Lua.
Implemented scheduled business metrics at the control plane of the API Gateway service (Java), along with a Grafana 
dashboard used by management to monitor deployments and feature usage. 
I also worked on a feature to scale Gateways to support higher throughput.

Software Developer – Createanet: 2017 – 2018 \
Prior to starting university, I worked at Createanet for a year primarily as an iOS developer. 
I developed 6 iOS apps mainly using Objective-C (and also some Swift). 
One of these apps was a social media platform, others were for photo and video sharing, electronic forms / paperless, 
consumer rewards, and video conferencing.
I also developed backend REST APIs and administration websites to manage the apps using PHP/MySQL.

Part-Time – IT Support, Brixham College: 2011 – 2015 \
Whilst I was at Brixham College I had a part-time job with the IT department, this mainly involved working with
Microsoft products such as Windows Server, Active Directory, Exchange Server, and Hyper-V. 
I was responsible for setting up the automated deployment of operating systems and software, first using WDS and later 
SCCM, for around 500 PCs. 
I also built and maintained the Remote Desktop services infrastructure for staff, students, and thin PCs.

I also maintain a list of projects I have worked on at [my website](https://www.jhalsey.com/projects.html), showing the 
software languages and frameworks that I am familiar with.
